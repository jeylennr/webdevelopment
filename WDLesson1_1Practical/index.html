<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
    <p>
            Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides a collection of pre-designed components, such as navigation bars, buttons, and forms, which help speed up the development process. With Bootstrap, developers can ensure their websites look consistent and function well across different devices and screen sizes.
